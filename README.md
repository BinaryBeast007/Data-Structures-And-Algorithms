## Overview

The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of data structures and algorithms implemented in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)/[Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and licensed under [MIT License](https://github.com/BinaryBeast007/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/blob/main/LICENSE). Source codes are compiled and tested for every commit on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-20-04-lts-arrives). The implementations and the associated documentation are meant to provide a good learning resource for data structures and algorithms. Hence, one may find more than one implementation for the same objective but using a different strategies and optimizations.

## Data Structures
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.
